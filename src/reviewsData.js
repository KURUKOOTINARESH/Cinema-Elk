            "content": "Movie is really good, but there is one obvious flaw and one important condition:\r\n\r\nFlaw: you'll have to endure every scene about Jann's relationships. With the parents it's just very predictable — just try to imagine, they didn't believe in him and persuaded to drop his dreams and find proper job. Of course, you know what will happen in the end. Okay, relationships with parents are always important, but WHY DID THEY ADD SCENES WITH THE GIRLFRIEND? Thanks for showing Tokyo during their weekend there, but I still can't understand the reason to add her in the first place — they didn't have conflicts, interesting dialogues or even support, really. I'm sure creators could invest time to more interesting and important topics.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, this flaw disappears in the shadow of other, actually important stuff. Racing.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, let's return to the condition: you have to love it when cars go BRRRRR. The main reason behind this movie is to sell you GT7 for your PS5, and believe me, after leaving the cinema, you'll at least check if there are any discounts for the game right now (yes, there are). Sound, shooting angles, tension during races — everything works perfectly and beyond! Just when you become bored, you'll be in for a surprise. When you want a new angle, you'll get it. When you forget who the sponsor of the movie is, you'll see graphics from the video game.\r\n\r\nSo, just believe me, if you love races, you have to go to the movie right now. Just select cinema with quality sound, please :)\r\n\r\nAnd as a bonus, you'll get David Harbour, who's stealing absolutely every scene. Love him!",

Being completely unaware of the inspirational true story on which the movie is based made it even more fascinating, engaging, and wildly exhilarating. Lorne Balfe and Andrew Kawczynski's score contains countless tracks loaded with extremely high levels of adrenaline that transform all racing sequences into moments of pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nExceptional performance by David Harbour, who commits himself to his role in such a way that, if the awards season started now and there was no clear dependence on marketing campaigns, the actor would be one of the frontrunners.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend not researching anything about the real story *before* the film, even if just to avoid dealing with the predictable, formulaic structure of this type of movie.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

            "content": "Archie Madekwe is quite good here as the gamer Jann Mardenborough who entered a competition devised by Nissan marketing man Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) to raise the profile of their sports cars in a league usually dominated by the likes of Porsche and Ferrari etc. There's a great degree of cynicism from the high-pressure, high-octane, industry that these glorified couch potatoes could ever make the grade, but with the help of slightly jaded but experienced coach Jack Salter (David Harbour) they decide to push these youngsters to their limits. What now ensues is based on fact, so we have little jeopardy to the ultimate denouement. That said, though, Neill Blomkamp manages to build the momentum well with some excellent action photography to get the adrenalin pumping. Neither Bloom nor Harbour are really here nor there, but the young Madekwe does manage to exude some of the grit and determination of his ambitious, fiercely competitive, and dedicated persona and it's been quite a while since I heard the dulcets of Enya emanate from a big screen. It does take a little while to get out of neutral - maybe just a bit too much familial scene setting to justify the fees of Geri Horner and Djimon Hounsou but once we escape that, the thing picks up entreatingly and is quite a thrill a times to watch. Definitely better on a big screen.",

Even GT (is a half-sim) has some reality way more than this. For starters Whats with the Hungaroring? Silverstone Academy is reverse Hungaroring, Le Mans (La Sarthe) is regular Hungaroring.... \r\nIn racing there is no wiggly helmets; cars don't explodes, engines do, there are no spotters except ovals!; track races have qualies, you don't start in the middle of nowhere; you dont pass your opponent with down shifts and sudden throttle; GT3 cars are fast as any car on straights; Le Mans 24H doesn't finish at the last lap; it finishes at the end of 24 hours + 1 lap; Nurburgring is 20.83 km and if you crash in the middle of it nobody waves yellow flags in start-finish straight. I could have add more but i am already bored. \r\nGood soundtrack, good cinematography, well blended CGI but no soul and no technical aspect. I don't even know how Yamauchi San gave his blessing to this as himself a real deal racing driver. Lastly this film is the second DRIVEN disaster IMO.(4/10)",

Entertainment is also guaranteed due to a good mix of CGI action with choreographed fight sequences, as well as an energetic score (Bobby Krlic).A movie that nonsensically finds itself labeled as part of the DCEU when it clearly belongs to the saga. James Gunn probably didn't want to risk starting the DCU with a lesser-known character, which is an understandable reason, but keeping it attached to a soon-to-be-extinguished cinematic universe is very questionable.There are no doubts: we will see Jaime Reyes again.Rating: B+",

Blue Beetle looks like a superhero origin combined with Iron Man, Venom, and Spider-Man, adding just a bit of the family dynamic from Encanto (or Fast & Furious, you decide).\r\n\r\nThe only outstanding thing is the cringe factor: strange jokes, graphics that are far from the best, and a derivative plot — everything looks like it was made in the 00s. It's not bad, really; sometimes, it's even good — you'll definitely giggle if you're into this style. However, it's not enough to label the movie as a good one.\r\n\r\nP.S. While watching this one, I've finally come up with the thought that I'm always bored during the first act. All these character introductions and exposition setups look like they're for people who are watching the first movie in their life.

            "content": "Maybe this should just have been called the \"Blue Bottle\" after the annoying blowfly that buzzes around annoyingly to no apparent purpose? Susan Sarandon (why?) is the megalomanic corporate mogul \"Kord\" who is out to create a super-soldier (\"OMAC\") using an extra-terrestrial scarab that can synergise an human being with an almost indestructible endo-skeleton. Fortunately for all of us, her cleaning lady likes to use the luxury bathroom at her home, and when she is caught and quite literally dumped, she and her brother find themselves out of work and introduced to \"Jenny\" (Bruna Marquezine) - the strong-minded niece of our baddie - who is determined to thwart the militarisation of her daddy's company.  She smuggles the gadget out of their HQ and manages to pass it to the rather earnest and drippy brother \"Jaime\" (Xolo Maridueña) with strict instructions not to even open the box. Of course they do, and next thing he and the glowing blue gizmo are best mates - he can fly, zip around with great speed and has, of course, super-human strength. \"Cord\" is determined to get it back, so she energises her already semi-mechanised henchman \"Carapax\" (Raoul Max Trujillo) for a gradual/glacial build up to a denouement that a bat could see from space. This has all the feel to it of a standard television movie. Great visual effects but lightning pyrotechnics, cleaving a bus in half and endless explosions are no longer enough to sell a film. There has to be some semblance of originality with the thing. Aside from it's bilinguality, this has precious little by way of innovation to shout for it. The characters are largely forgettable - especially the annoying uncle \"Rudy\" (George Lopez) who's astonishing adeptness with all things super-tech was just plain daft! It's also way, way too long and I felt the ominous presence of a sequel looming at the end quite sad. This is a weak story with a weak cast that seems designed to fill a gap in the USA's expanding and under-served Hispanic market. I think it may work there? I'm not so sure anyone else needs this.",

The team now travel to a remote installation where they must investigate some more of the beasties that live below the frozen layer put there by nature to ensure than we don't mix. Thing is, it seems they are not the only folks who've hit on the idea that there might be untapped riches 25,000 feet below the surface, and soon our team are involved in a contretemps with \"Montes\" (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) that introduces treachery, double-dealing and causes explosions galore that release not just megs, but also an enormous octopus into the ocean where they can merrily terrorise the holidaymakers on the nearby resort of \"Fun Island\". Can \"Jonas\" et al manage to take on four of these super-creatures before they've snacked their way through the tourists? This might have been a bit better if they'd just cut all the preamble and gone straight to the rig and to the underwater action, big fish and pyrotechnics. As it is, we spend far too long meandering about on the surface meeting the characters and there's way too much pointless dialogue throughout - though one or two half-hearted witticisms and puns help a little - before an ending that is entirely predictable and really rather processionally so. The acting is just banal, the continuity is all over the place - as is the editing - and the huge chunk of Ali Baba money that's floated this thing ensures that the switches from the English to Chinese languages actually smacks more of keeping everybody happy in the boardroom rather than engaging anyone in the actual cinema. Simply, even the charismatic Statham cannot rescue this from the doldrums of CGI-led mediocrity that churns out an unremarkable hybrid of \"Jaws\" and \"Jurassic Park\". It does need a big screen. If you wait til it's on the telly then you will be even more disappointed. Mind you, is that actually possible?",

            "content": "Life as a teenager is never easy and when you are gifted with the superhuman abilities of a spider and lead a double life as a student and crime fighter; life gets even harder.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (Shameik Moore) is finding it even harder to hide his secret from his family who has grown concerned that his erratic behavior is more than the usual teenage angst.\r\n\r\nIn another earth, Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) deals with her Police officer father desperately hunting down her alter-ego believing that she is a killer which drives a wedge between them as Gwen desperately tries to find her way forward.\r\n\r\nIn “Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse audiences learn that what one perceives as reality is often just the corner of a much larger picture and when Miles confronts what he dismisses as a “Villain of the Week” in a quirky enemy known as The Spot (Jason Schwartzman), starts a campaign against Spider-Man, he soon finds that the threat is much larger than he expected and secretly follows a visiting Gwen into an another Earth where his actions soon draw the attention of a larger temporal Spider squad.\r\n\r\nMotivated by his feelings for Gwen and a desire to do good, Miles looks to undo the damage that the Spot is causing across various Earths and learns that each one has its own version of Spider-man or Woman to protect it.\r\n\r\nAt this point the film goes into overdrive as Miles learns more about his past and how he became Spider-Man but also learns more about the cost that his powers enact on his life and those around him. There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it.\r\n\r\nThe film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film.\r\n\r\nI first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

            "content": "Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it’s also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you’d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey’s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it’s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there’s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole “multiverse” theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I’m not sure I’ll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for “Miles” and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.",

Separately from enjoying this movie or not, any or all cinephiles should bow to the ridiculously talented artists and animators behind this pure work of art.\r\n\r\nThat said, the attributes and issues are more or less the same as the original. The various animation styles are overwhelmingly stunning, but also to the point of creating confusing moments. Gwen Stacy stands out from the rest of the pack – both the character and Hailee Steinfeld's voice performance – but everyone on screen is impressively captivating. The voice cast is superb all-around.\r\n\r\nAn unfinished story – remember, this is the first of two parts – about what it really means to be a hero. The 140-minute runtime isn't exactly heavy, but the necessity to resort to exposition scenes is more frequent than in the previous flick, even though the narrative complexity ends up justifying this.\r\n\r\nA must-see movie in the cinema! Go support animation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

            "content": "I don't know, but in my humble opinion, the punk Spider-Man really needed to look like Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, someone from the Sex Pistols.  He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.\r\n\r\nThey really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker \"Mild Morales.\"  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  \r\n\r\nBut he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nAnd I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.\r\n\r\nOver-all though, it's not bad.  It's better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it's probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn't totally political BS.",

            "content": "I don’t have that much to say about “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” except that it’s easily one of the best films of the year. It’s the type of achievement in animation that’s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it’s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he’s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn’s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.\r\n\r\nThe plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don’t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it’s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo.\r\n\r\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\r\n\r\n“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore",

            "content": "The latest in the long-running and popular Transformer series has arrived with “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”.  Taking a cue from the recent “Bumblebee” movie,  the movie cleverly serves not only as a prequel but as a platform to introduce a series of stories leading up to the original films.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a planet-destroying evil is fixated on obtaining a key that will allow it to travel to any point in the universe to continue its reign of destruction. The animal-based Maximals are able to escape with the key and hide it on Earth where they will also remain in secret as guardians.\r\n\r\nFlash forward to 1994 when Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos), following his stint in the Army is looking to find gainful employment to help his mother as well as his ailing brother.  Despite being a wizard with electronics Noah is not considered to be a team player which has hampered his job prospects and leads him to consider criminal activities in an effort to obtain much-needed funds for his brother's medical bills.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of desperation, Noah attempts to steal a loaded Porsche but finds he is unable to follow through on the act as it is against his moral compass.  Unknown to Noah the car is actually an Autobot named Mirage (Pete Davidson), who soon enlists Noah to help them find the key which they have recently detected.\r\n\r\nThis does not sit well with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), who believes that humanity will only act in your best interests and that his crew needs to find the key so that they can return to their war-ravaged, Cybertron.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a crafty but perpetually overlooked museum intern named Elena (Dominique Fishback), has accidentally activated the key and in doing so has allowed the evil Scourge (Peter Dinklage), and his minions to zero in on its location as he attempts to obtain the key for his master and is willing to destroy all were in his way.\r\n\r\nNoah and Elena soon find themselves paired with their unexpected allies as they race to stop the evil from obtaining both parts of the key and find themselves with some unexpected allies in the form of the Maximals.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a frantic action-adventure film that cleverly combines humor, action, dazzling visual effects, and a tail that is part Indiana Jones, and Transformers with a surprising amount of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for the human cast the overshadowed by the massive and visually spectacular creations that frequently transform and battle it out across numerous action sequences.  However, director Steven Caple Jr. takes advantage of his young talent both of whom are clearly potential stars in the making as they provide a grounding humanity to the film which makes it more than a lavish FX showcase.\r\n\r\nThe film also has an impressive era-specific soundtrack and a scene near the end that offers up some intriguing and exciting possibilities for the future. \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" is a highly enjoyable summer action adventure as well as one the more enjoyable films in the franchise and should delight fans of the franchise and has me for the first time in a long time eagerly awaiting what comes next.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

            "content": "You know what - this is my favourite \"Transformers\" movie. Now that's not really saying much, most of them are pretty poor, but somehow the shamelessly derivative nature of this just made it more entertaining. It all starts with \"Optimus Primal\" (aka. \"Kingus Kongus\") having a fight with the all-consuming \"Unicron\" (narked because a typo robbed him of his chance to just be an horse with an horn) for a key that can open portals between worlds enabling the baddie to quite literally eat them and move on. The solution to that battle is a bit of a compromise and scoot forward hundreds of year and New Yorker \"Noah\" (Anthony Ramos) has a problem. His younger brother \"Kris\" (Dean Scott Vasquez) is very poorly and they cannot afford his medical bills. \"Noah\" turns to crime and that's where he encounters the newly invigorated \"Autobots\" who have realised that \"Elena\" (Dominique Fishback) - a researcher in a museum - has rediscovered the hidden key. They have to retrieve it before it falls into more malevolent hands. Soon the two hapless humans and their robots are engaged in a battle royal that sees the museum pretty much trashed before they head to Peru where they encounter the \"Maximals\" and the beautiful Inca terraces are soon for the chop too. So far I reckon we've been through loads of episodes of \"Stargate\" as well \"King Kong\" (probably the Peter Jackson one), \"The Goblet of Fire\"; \"Independence Day\", \"Star Trek\" (JJ Abrams version), all four \"Indiana Jones\" films - which, to be fair are even acknowledged in the script, and the armoured eagle \"Airazor\" reminded me of a hairier version of \"Bubo\" from \"Clash of the Titans\". The visuals are excellent and for the most part it's got plenty of action but as we near the ever-so-predictable denouement the pace slackens off and cheesy sentiment brings the thing to a grinding halt a couple of times! There's no jeopardy at all, really, and given that \"Optimus Prime\" - maybe he ought to be called \"Hopeless Prime\" because he is pretty useless in a fight - gets to make his grand speech at the end, I'm sure there will be more for our intrepid young \"Noah\" to come. Big screen essential - this will look bland and repetitive on the telly. Maybe it'll help sell some toys?",

Rise of the Beasts establishes some decent human leads that aren’t annoying while keeping the focus on the robot conflict. The voice cast was fantastic! Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will always be the greatest of all time. Peter Dinklage’s Scourge sounds and looks vicious. Ron Perlman, Michelle Yeoh, Pete Davidson, and Cristo Fernández provide solid performances, giving their characters a little fun and even some heart. Rise of the Beasts reels the franchise back in from the outrageous goofiness of the Wahlberg entries but still has a good time recognizing its primary audience is kids and parents who grew up on the cartoon. The intensity and pacing of the first 2 acts are superb! The final act gets a little cheesy and starts to feel generic, but it is no worse than the climax of recent Marvel films. Rise of the Beasts isn’t perfect but it sets the Transformers back on the right path.",

            "content": "EXT. INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF THE LOST DIALS SKULL – DAY\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more closely related to its recent sequel than its distant cousins of the original trilogy. It attempts to take the franchise's formula and shake it up; it throws in cameos, call-backs and references but suffers the same issue every recent Lucasfilm movie has. \r\n\r\nIt's another modern Disney reboot sequel with legacy characters left in the dirt, and a 'quirky & quippy' new character is presented to us. You know this character type when in the face of fear, they will make fun of the villain's Lactose Intolerance or something random because this character is flawlessly confident. They are knowledgeable on every subject relevant to the plot, smartasses because they are always correct, sassy when held hostage and always have an escape plan. This is Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridges), and she might be the only consistent character in the film. For the rest of the ensemble, Boyd Holbrooks Klaber speaks once in the movie and then chases after Jones in each scene; Mads Mikkelsens Jürgen Voller is the most forgettable antagonist of the franchise, Antonio Banderas is out of the film faster than he's in it and finally, Harrison Ford as Dr Jones is unfortunately back for what seems like a pretty good paycheck.\r\n\r\nI have nothing against the performances themselves. The cast is incredibly talented, but this skilled team cannot hide the terrible dialogue reinforcing the rather forgettable story. Ultimately, Indiana Jones has one of the greatest trilogies of films with a distance spin-off universe of sequels. Lucasfilm, post-2008, has not been your era.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT.",

            "content": "Legendary archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), has returned to what is the film as his final outing in \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\". The film is the first in the series since Disney acquired Lucasfilm and the first not to benefit from involvement by Gorge Lucas or the direction of Steven Spielberg. James Mangold has taken on directing duties and faces the challenge of delivering a satisfying solution to the series and one that atones for the disappointing \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\".\r\nThe film opens in the waning days of World War II when the imminent defeat of the Nazis has caused a mass exodus of their plundered archaeological treasures which draws Jones into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe digital de-aging technology is impressive as we get an extended sequence of the younger Jones and his colleague Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), in a frantic and at times humorous segment that evokes memories of some of the finer moments from the series.\r\nFlash forward to 1969 as the world prepares to celebrate the return of the lunar astronauts, Jones is dealing with the pending retirement from teaching as well as issues in his personal life.\r\nWhen a figure from his past named Helena (Phoene Waller-Bridge) who happens to be his Goddaughter evokes memories of a disagreement with her father several years earlier over the fabled Dial of Destiny which Indiana and her father were able to retrieve half of earlier in the film.\r\n\r\nAt the same time former Nazi scientists Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), who is receiving his kudos as a key part of sending men to the moon and back, plots to obtain both parts of the Dial and with his legion of deadly assassins in tow, sets his sights on Jones and Shaw.\r\n\r\nThings become even more complicated when Jones is framed for murder and forced to flee in pursuit of Shaw sees archaeological discoveries as nothing more than a financial gain versus their historical significance.\r\nFrom New York to Tangiers, Greece, and other locales, Jones, Shaw, and her sidekick Teddy (Ethan Isidore), this battle against each other as well as the menace that constant Voller presents as they attempt to decipher the clues to combine the Dial and keep it from those who use it evil.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it is interspersed throughout the film and while not the FX-laden visual abundance that modern audiences have come to expect, they are generally satisfying and factor in that the title character is a senior citizen pushing 80 and as such does some remarkably impressive action when called upon even though he does in one scene to lying about his various injuries and trials that he has faced over the years and the toll they take it upon his body.\r\n\r\nSome fans may say there was not enough action for the hook was not as compelling as in previous adventures. While this is certainly a valid thought process the film should delight true fans of the series as it is an appropriate look at the aging adventurer as he is pulled back into the field once again.  There is also the matter of the new music from John Williams which sets the tone for the film well.\r\n\r\nFord and Waller-Bridge work well with one another and there are some surprise guests that appear along the way one should delight fans. I found the movie to be more satisfying than the last two films in that the focus was on the character and themes of life, loss, aging, and doing what was right versus an abundance of action around a treasure hunt.\r\n\r\nIt will be different things to different people but for me, \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is a loving send-off to the beloved character and one that cements the iconic Jones as a true cinematic classic.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

            "content": "It seems these days that it’s become all too easy to blast popular, commercial fare simply because it is popular, commercial fare. Granted, some offerings of this type genuinely deserve whatever grief they get, but others, such as the latest installment in this long-running franchise, don’t merit unfair potshots fired at them just for innately being mainstream offerings. In many ways, this is very much cut from the same cloth as its action adventure predecessors, but there are enough distinctions, new developments and lesser-known elements to keep it fresh and interesting throughout. Now, this is not to suggest that this final entry in this action adventure series is without its faults – it’s overlong, some of its action sequences could have been easily pared back (despite generally being as good as they are) and the storyline tends to sag somewhat in the middle. However, Indiana Jones has once again given us a rollicking good time with a captivating narrative, an intriguing assortment of twists and turns, and an array of colorful characters all vying for their piece of the pie (if not the entire pie itself). The film also provides fans of the franchise with deftly handled touches at achieving closure for the series, without dangling obvious or ambiguous carrots of there being more to come or any kind of impending reboot. Director James Mangold successfully puts the series to bed and tucks it in nicely while rounding off any remaining edges, something that it and its fans deserve. So, to all those cynics out there who are shamelessly bashing this release to be fashionable or hip, all I can say is “pipe down and lose the attitude already.”",

            "content": "When the title card for the latest Indiana Jones movie came on the big screen I was excited to hear the famous score, see Harrison Ford don his famous fedora and intrigued to see how they would handle Indy’s age in this 40-year-old franchise.\r\n\r\nThe opening encounter was very familiar, with Indy fighting Nazis during World War 2. We are introduced to the antiquity and lore that is the basis for this adventure. This start was a little jarring at first, but I was soon enthralled by the action and comedy.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Toby Jones' brief appearance at the beginning, but the villain played by Mads Mikkelsen was severely underutilised. The runtime was a little long, with the middle feeling rather lethargic. I would have preferred a little more low-key adventuring, similar to the exploration of Archimedes's tomb, than the bigger action sequences.\r\n\r\nThere was a definite nostalgia kick to the entire movie. There was a new young sidekick and old familiar faces. There was the trademark adventure, creepy crawlies and historical riddles. There were Nazis, car chases and fight scenes. There was some fun deadpan comedy. The iconic travel map made an appearance – with a couple in front pointing at the screen in excitement when it appeared. But it was hearing the score throughout that was the biggest endorphin kick. It was definitely an Indiana Jones movie.\r\n\r\nFifteen years after the disappointing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this is a satisfying movie that I enjoyed. In the end, it concludes Indy’s story, while potentially passing the adventuring on to another generation.",

            "content": "_Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_ feels like the type of sequel that aimed to capture the magic of its predecessors, had worthwhile intentions, and a talented cast, but it just never properly materialized. The film seems to teeter on the sheer annoyance of a main character grappling with the fact that he’s now a crotchety and wrinkly senior citizen and not the young, grizzled, adventurer he used to be.\r\n\r\nWith an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully _The Dial of Destiny_ is the final Indy film.

Thank you Doomcock, without your intervention this movie would have been even worse.  It shows, the plot is messy, the re-shoots are a little obvious story-wise as Disney did their best to attempt to avoid the fan backlash promised for when their plans were to kill Indy off and have Phoebe replace him....\r\n\r\n... and then when when they re-shoot it again because the fans didn't want to see Indiana Jones be ridiculed constantly by his female replacement in an effort to make the KK stand-in come across as better in every way... and a lot of that is still there in the final product.\r\n\r\nLike Star Wars did to Skywalker, Indiana Jones is constantly shamed by the younger more diverse version... who can't seem to decide what character she wants to be.  Rogue?  Scholar?  Conman? Her personality changes as the script dictates, but Indiana remains pathetic... so that Strong Female Lead can look better.\r\n\r\nIn the end it's a mess, and the result is that Disney killed another fan favorite Franchise.  Star Wars, Willow, and now Indy.  They paid out the nose for all of them and then made them worthless.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of conspiracies floating around about it, but it don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.",

Years go by and \"Indy\" (Harrison Ford) is now a soon-to-be divorced, retiring, professor who encounters the daughter of his late friend - \"Helena/Wombat\" (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and soon the two are engaged as a slightly untrustworthy pairing seeking to retrieve the other half of this dial before the newly empowered \"Voller\" manages to manipulate the CIA into helping him to obtain it and rewrite history. Aside from the fact that the star is still very much a star, and his charisma does lots to keep this going; the film is itself a really rather unremarkable, procedural, adventure story that includes all the staple ingredients of the first three films but without the depth of the supporting characters. Mikkelsen doesn't really cut it as a baddie any more and Waller-Bridge is largely out of her depth and relies rather heavily on her teenage sidekick \"Teddy\" (Ethann Isidore) to be the foil for her rather obvious witticisms and slightly unscrupulous behaviour. It doesn't hang about and the visual effects are pretty standard but the writing is really quite pedestrian and the ending seemed borne more of a need to finish the film rather than complete the really pretty thin story that really does tee up a sequel! It's perfectly watchable, but is a distant cousin of the earlier iterations for this character and is also perfectly forgettable too.",

            "content": "“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is a stale, impotent summer blockbuster that marks another unimaginative entry in the popular adventure franchise. Excessively dull and far too long, director James Mangold‘s movie burns every last drop of goodwill that’s left in the tank. This fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones saga is a pathetic sendoff to one of the most iconic big screen characters of all time.\r\n\r\nSet in 1969, Daredevil archaeologist Henry “Indiana” Jones (Harrison Ford) is still working as a professor, but today is his retirement day. In his final class, a young woman from his past turns up: his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She’s in search of a mystical device that her father Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) obsessed over until the day he died, and Indy knows its historical significance all too well. It’s been said that the Antikythera (the Greek name for the Dial of Destiny), can alter the course of history and time, and it would turn any person who held it into a god. Soon Indy and Helena find out that former Nazi and current NASA scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) also wants the device for himself so he can change the outcome of World War II, and it becomes a race against time (and a very dangerous enemy) if they want to save history as the world knows it.\r\n\r\nIt’s not a bad story overall, but it certainly is a mess of one. It’s extremely slow, and the most interesting parts happen in the film’s final 45 minutes. That means there’s an abundance of bland filler and tepid action chase scenes that fill screen time before all the good stuff happens. There’s a lot of déjà vu at play here, as Mangold tries to milk fond memories of the earlier (and best) “Raiders” films, and he’s not shy about masking his intentions. The film brings back classic characters like Marion (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who only briefly appear as a means of tugging on the heartstrings (and reminding audiences of far, far better movies).\r\n\r\nThere are so many missteps in this film that it becomes more of a bore than a fun means of escapism. The opening sequence is a little fun, but it’s too reminiscent of the circus train intro in “Last Crusade.” There’s another tuk tuk chase that’s eerily familiar to the mine cars in “Temple of Doom.” The script (which credits four writers) inserts plenty of winks and nudges as it references the most classic Indiana Jones films. While the crack of Indy’s whip and the moment he dons his famous brown fedora may get those feel-good endorphins flowing, it also makes in painfully clear that a movie can only coast so far on nostalgia.\r\n\r\nA large chunk of the problem is (surprisingly) with the character. An archaeologist outsmarting Nazi villains feels more dated in today’s society than it should, even though the film is set in the late ’60s. Indiana Jones will always be a classic of course, and the studio should be applauded for its decision not to recast Ford in what is in the top two of his most iconic roles. What’s cringey is the use of de-aging software for the scenes that take place in the past, which makes Ford look plastic, fake, and straight out of a Pixar movie. It doesn’t work, it’s distracting, and it arguably was unnecessary within the confines of the story the film is trying to tell.\r\n\r\nOne of the positives is that Ford is clearly still a movie star, and he holds the movie together with what appears to be minimal effort. Yes, it’s easy to tell when a stunt person is standing in and it’s obvious through some clever (and choppy) editing that Ford wasn’t personally able to perform all of the physicality the role demanded, but he still lives and breathes Indiana Jones, so much so that after a little bit of time, you don’t even see him as an old man. The addition of Waller-Bridge adds a refreshing spark to the film, and her character and performance are quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI don’t think “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will perform well across generations, but Gen Xers and older audiences will be delighted to see one of their favorite characters back in his own action / adventure story. What a pity this is the best sendoff that could be mustered for Indy after all this time.",

If you apply some suspension of disbelief to accept that it would be possible to a single man to survive being followed by an army of enemies, Kandahar is actually a quite well-made movie!

            "content": "Gerard Butler is an actor who knows his strengths and takes roles that play to them, and his charismatic lead performance is one of the best things about “Kandahar,” a military action thriller about undercover CIA operative Tom (Gerard Butler) who is stuck deep in hostile territory in Afghanistan with his translator, Mo (Navid Negahban). It’s vaguely familiar to this year’s “The Covenant” from Guy Ritchie, yet the two films are very different. Here, the two men must work together to avoid the elite special forces unit that has been tasked with hunting them down after their mission is exposed.\r\n\r\nThe plot is very by-the-book and simple, but Mitchell LaFortune’s script features thoughtful writing with a politically-minded slant. There’s a lot of conversational drama that feels draggy in parts (and a lot of it is offset by massive explosions and flashy shootouts), but the screenplay is not mindless. It’s exhausting to keep track of the roster of characters and factions and how they are working with or against each other, but the focus on the narrative is the relationship between Mo and Tom and their will to survive. Their friendship is crucial to the story, but you must suspend disbelief because there’s no way these two would develop such a close bond in such a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nThe film is well cast and features solid performances from all involved, which in turn helps create a stronger emotional bond between the audience and the characters. The stakes are high and the danger feels real, which makes every shootout affecting and tense. You’ll genuinely root for these guys to make it out alive, but getting to their final extraction point quickly becomes a dicey proposition.\r\n\r\nDirector Ric Roman Waugh, who worked with Butler on “Angel Has Fallen” and “Greenland” is perfectly acceptable behind the camera, but the too-dark cinematography and annoying overuse of shaky handheld cameras are both extremely aggravating as a viewer. The monotonous chase – shoot – repeat formula grows tiresome very quickly.\r\n\r\nDespite its somewhat predictable story, “Kandahar” tries to tackle some sophisticated commentary about the cycle of violence and war in the Middle East. This makes it a decent (if forgettable) movie where the action scenes come with a dose of emotional weight, and not just explosions for the sake of empty entertainment.",

It is deep, and shows from time to time, inside adult jokes that will need explaining to kids. So I recommend that if kids watch it, **which is ok, nothing weird, it is safe for kids**, an adult will be present to answer questions and explain these jokes.",

It features a visually stunning inter-element love story mixed with a beautiful journey of self-discovery. The outstanding world-building is once again a highlight, as are the numerous exceptionally enlightening visual details about the interaction between the different elements. Emigration, discrimination, and family ideals are some of the many essential topics addressed.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the criticism surrounding the alleged \"fall of Pixar\" and this latest movie. I will continue to enjoy these stories, and I highly recommend that viewers try to do the same, without worrying about incessantly comparing to what came before.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

            "content": "\"Ember\" and her ailing grandfather arrive in the big city where everyone is personified as one of the four natural elements. Needless to say, fire is not the most popular but they resolve to open their shop selling all things smoked, toasted, burnt, and red hot! It's an old building, though, and when one day the pipes give birth to the local, watery, buildings inspector \"Wade\" she discovers that they have no planning permission for their business and that he is going to have to report them. What now ensues is, sadly, a rather unimaginative series of escapades as she must track him down and stop him - and the authorities - from closing down the family's flaming enterprise. The animation is characterful and top notch - and the story certainly had potential, but somehow the thing just becomes a bit of a cheesy romance all too quickly. A lot more fun could have been had demonstrating just how incompatible the four - air, earth, water and fire - can be when mixed together; or - indeed - how symbiotic they can be, but the emphasis and the dialogue focusses just a bit too much on \"Ember\" and \"Wade\" and I am afraid that I rather lost interest. It's colourful and vibrant, there is some entertaining action with plenty of pyrotechnics and is worth a watch, but it will look just as good on the television and doesn't live up to the hype, sorry",

            "content": "\"Elemental\" is an outstanding Pixar movie that utilizes the medium of animation to tell a compelling story. It goes beyond being just a rom-com and instead offers a powerful narrative about people, even though the characters represent elements. Pixar effectively uses various elements to convey a captivating human story that resonates with viewers. The film highlights the idea that despite our differences, we can coexist in a society that often tries to separate us. \"Elemental\" stands out as one of the most visually colourful movies with excellent music, including a memorable end credits song. While children may not fully grasp the film's deep concepts, it leaves a lasting impact on their lives, and when they revisit it as adults, they will come to understand its profound message.",

I mean after all, there was a time when I trusted the mainstream media and I lost trust in them not because they were mainstream, but because they just started to get a lot of things wrong. But that also means that if they get things right for once, I can't just categorically disagree with them.\r\n\r\nAnd it's really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. They do (for the most part) have a valid point. This movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it. On the contrary, because it claims to be based on true events, it causes people to have a completely wrong impression about this and therefore makes it harder for people to detect it when it's happening, because this movie is less accurate in its depiction of the real world than a Liam Neeson action thriller. Actually, Liam Neeson's recent film \"Memory\" was pretty good and actually much more accurate in it's depiction of child trafficking than this movie.\r\n\r\nBecause this movie really does nothing but reinforce outdated and completely wrong stereotypes. This type of thing isn't something that mainly happens in South America or in \"other\" countries and children don't just get kidnapped out of the blue by complete strangers and against their will. The sad truth is that most cases don't involve a stranger at all, but someone the child trusts and the child isn't gonna come running to you begging for help, cause the truth is they are victims of years of extremely systematic and sophisticated psychological manipulation.\r\n\r\nAnd the perpetrators aren't all tough guys either. Actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don't raise suspicion. And also it's not just about forcing the kids to make movies - that only plays a very, very small part, but this movie would have you believe that that's the main part - that's the smallest part by far! Most of the aspects involved are MUCH worse than \"just\" that. \r\n\r\nAnd as much as I would love to think that there are plenty of officers (official or rogue) of government security agencies who are incorruptible and ceaselessly fight the \"bad guys\" in relentless sting operations, the reality sadly isn't as clear cut. Yes, sometimes SOME children do get rescued, but actually very rarely by police, much less government security agencies. Well, there was that ONE case in Bosnia where a policewoman and member of an international agency uncovered a human trafficking operation - but then again the people running it were her colleagues...",

He teams-up with a former cartel accountant (Bill Camp) to track down the kid’s sister in which he must eventually infiltrate a camp of Columbian revolutionaries in the Amazon jungle.\r\n\r\nMade in 2018 but not released until 2023, “Sound of Freedom” is based on the real-life story of Tim Ballard, the founder of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.). It features actual footage of children being captured by slavers on CCTV. Imagine a more gritty-realistic version of the “Taken” movies, with Liam being replaced by Caviezel, and that’s this film.\r\n\r\nThis is a well-done, eye-opening picture about the perverted human cockroaches amongst us, but it isn’t entertaining in the conventional sense for obvious reasons. It amusingly became anathema to Lefties, also for obvious reasons.      \r\n\r\nThe flick runs 2 hours, 11 minutes, and was shot in Cartagena, Colombia with additional scenes done in Calexico, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

Inevitable awards are on the way for the brightly colored production design, costumes, and makeup.\r\n\r\nGreta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach's narrative unapologetically tackles quite serious topics, from sociopolitical matters like patriarchy and sexual harassment to questions about existential crises, personal identity, self-love, and, of course, the roles of women and men in today's society.\r\n\r\nMargot Robbie was destined to play Barbie just as Ryan Gosling was born with Kenergy in his veins.

            "content": "\"Thus Spake Zarabarbie\" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's \"Barbieland\". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink \"Groundhog Day\". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned \"Ken\" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a \"Barbie\". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical \"Barbie\" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See \"Weird Barbie\" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted \"Ken\" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by \"Sasha\" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged \"Ken\" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend \"Sasha\", her much less cyclical mother \"Gloria\" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever \"Carla\" from \"Cheers!\") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole \"Barbie\" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",

It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!) It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.\r\n\r\nThe writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role — especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.\r\n\r\nIt's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see. It's _hard_ to watch, as a man—feeling responsible for so many challenges women face—but Barbie doesn't judge, it voices. It's a message that informs me, helps me, as well as entertaining me, but it isn't meant for _me_; the extent to which Yvette felt seen, understood and perfectly spoken on behalf of _is_ this movie, and why it deserves all the praise it's getting.\r\n\r\nOriginally posted at: https://www.byjp.me/posts/reviews/movies/barbie/",

            "content": "“Heavy is the arm that wears its heart on its sleeve.” That’s the best way to sum up this overwritten, overlong, stunningly obvious treatise on gender equality, consumerism and existentialism, whose messages get beaten to death beginning early on and never let up, an exhausting experience, to be sure. Writer-director Greta Gerwig’s latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that’s about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What’s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like “writing” than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, “Barbie” does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I’ll easily forget before year’s end – and one that conclusively proves the power of marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.",

But the story is very weak -- the Gloria/Sasha tie-in felt ham-fisted and the 'bonding' Barbie has at the end with Ruth makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that throughout the whole movie you're being hit over the head with a message that they *really* want to make sure you understand (how many times can you say 'patriarchy'?)

The only way this critique on power and status quo could be misconstrued as an attack on men is if people think power and control of the status quo belong only to men — which, eureka! is precisely what this movie is speaking to.\r\n\r\n\"When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression\".",

On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.",

The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity.

As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. \r\n\r\nThe cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.\r\n\r\nInstagram @streamgenx",

            "content": "Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how \"Dom\" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of \"Dante\" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the \"family\" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from \"Cipher\" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of \"Tej\" (Ludacris) and \"Roman\" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.",

            "content": "Writing a review for a sequel like “Fast X” feels pretty pointless. It’s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I’m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect “Fast X” to be a film that’s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It’s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\r\n\r\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, “Fast Five.” If you don’t remember the movie, don’t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He’s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his “family” are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\r\n\r\nThe story isn’t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about “family” and “faith.” The jokes aren’t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier‘s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman’s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in “F9” seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie — but there’s also plenty to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there’s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nThe film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom’s son don’t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).\r\n\r\nAlthough I’m a fan of all things “Fast and Furious,” it’s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. “Fast X” feels like it’s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you’re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it’s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.",

            "content": "I've more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment, the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie, it's becoming harder and harder to really be entertained, not to mention care one iota about these characters. I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical \"Fast\" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.\r\n\r\nGiven I wasn't that big of a fan of Fate of the Furious or F9, I think I've grown out of this franchise and would be a good thing to bring it to a close. **2.5/5**",

            "content": "When a group of kids get together under the thumb of the rather odious \"Hayley\" (Zoe Terakes) they are presented with a ceramic hand - that apparently encases a real one - that acts as a portal to a dimension in which live the dead. They have discovered that no harm can be done if they stick to a time limit, exceed that - and well they are in virgin and potentially perilous territory. Following on from her best friend \"Jade\" (Alexandra Jensen) who has a go, it falls to \"Mia\" (Sophie Wilde) and after the most bizarre of personally traumatic connections, she is soon addicted to the experience and is also soon providing a conduit that is causing havoc within their group - not least for poor young \"Riley\" (Joe Bird) who ends up needing danger money - and a soft play area! Wilde does quite well here and though the rest of the acting isn't really up to much, the story has an originality to it that genuinely creates a new avenue for a genre that has been really suffering from same old, same old storytelling of late. Bird is by far the star here - even if he is incapacitated for much of it, and the aforementioned Terakes creates a character I'd cheerfully throttle. There's too much dialogue and it's very very score-heavy which did annoy after a while, but it's at times quite scary and definitely worth a watch around Halloween on the telly.",
